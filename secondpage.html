          <p class="blogPara"><firstletter>T</firstletter>his week saw the end of buzz drama Moonlight Drawn By Clouds, which pulled in an impressive 23.3% and 22.9% for its final two episodes, respectively. The only Big 3 broadcast channel competition it faced on Monday was Woman With a Suitcase, since Moon Lovers: Scarlet Heart Ryeo was pre-empted at the last minute for a baseball game.</p>

          <p class="blogPara">
          That pre-emption seemed to cause some confusion in the international sphere, but everything was right back on track for the show on Tuesday. Unfortunately, the day off didn’t do the show any favors in terms of ratings, since it pulled in a very moderate 5.9%. It’s Drinking Solo over on cable that’s been getting better and better, managing to pull in in 4.4% with its even episode this week.</p>

          <p class="blogPara">
          But the real surprise seems to be coming from the middle of the week, with Shopping King Louis looking poised to possibly overtake Jealousy Incarnate. That really wasn’t something I was expecting, especially considering the head start Jealousy got, but it’s fun to have some shakeups now and then.</p>

          <p class="blogPara">
          Over on the weekend, Fantastic finished up its poignant run at 2.4%, while tvN’s The K2 keeps flirting with that 6% mark. Maybe one day, maybe never.</p>

          <p class="blogPara">After a successful run of promotions with title track ‘Fly’ and follow-up single ‘Homerun’ in Korea, multinational boy group GOT7 (JB, Mark, Junior, Jackson, Youngjae, Bambam, Yugyeom) launched the namesake ‘Fly’ concert series in support of their latest mini album ‘Flight Log: Departure‘.</p>

          <p class="blogPara">
          Kicking off with opening concerts in Seoul on April 29 – 30, the members will be continuing on to stops in China, Japan and Thailand before capping off the Asian leg of the world tour in Singapore. Fresh off several music show trophy wins and a meteoric rise in popularity, the boys will no doubt be coming into the Suntec Singapore Convention & Exhibition Centre riding a huge wave of confidence.</p>

          <p class="blogPara">
         Diehard IGOT7s would surely have seen the boys in action during their previous events and fan-meetings in Singapore, but for those of you needing a primer on the group’s signature brand of live performances, we make the case and list four reasons to catch GOT7 at their ‘Fly in Singapore’ event next month:</p>
